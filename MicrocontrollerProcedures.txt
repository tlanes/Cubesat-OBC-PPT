Procedures for Uploading Code to Microcontroller
	-Dominic Bonelli

1) Open ISP sketch by going to File > Examples > ArduinoISP

2) Load this ISP sketch into your Arduino

3) Find and install the Arduino core support for the microcontroller 
you want to program. For instance, here is the core support for an
ATMega 16/16A: https://github.com/sudar/arduino-extra-cores
Here is the core support for an ATtiny microcontroller:
https://github.com/damellis/attiny

4) Connect the microcontroller to your Arduino using the configuration
shown here: 
http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/use-arduino-as-an-isp-programmer-to-program-non-arduino-avr-microcontrollers
To do this, we will need:
	-Some wires
	-A breadboard
	-USB cable to Arduino
	-The Arduino (duh)
	-An LED
	-Our desired mircocontroller
	-A 10 uF capacitor

5) In the ISP sketch, burn the bootloader by selecting Tools > Burn
Bootloader. Make sure that you select the correct board.

6) Upload your sketch

NOTE: these instructions are for the ATMega16 microcontroller. These
instructions may vary if we use at different one.
